# http_example

### An example of a very simple HTTP response server

##### This file contains one python file and one image:
- ```server_http.py```
- ```icon.png```

##### ```server_http.py``` contains four editable constants:
- ```SERVER_HOST_ADDRESS``` - The IP address the server is hosted on
- ```SERVER_PORT``` - The port the server is hosted on
- ```REQUESTS``` - The max number of concurrent connection requests
- ```MESSAGE_SIZE``` - The max message size in bytes (*recommend* to keep the same as client)
- ```IMAG_LOC``` - The location of the icon image (preset to "icon.png")

###### This is run by executing the python script ```server_http.py```
